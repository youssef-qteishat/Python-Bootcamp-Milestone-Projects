# Python-Bootcamp-Milestone-Projects

Milestone Project #1 is tic-tac-toe in python. Essentially, this is how it is going to work:

1-) we first assign each player with either 'X' or 'O' using the pick_string() function
2-) display the empty board
3-) in the position_choice() function, the player is prompted to enter an integer value within 1 and 9.
4-) the replacement value function takes in the board list and the player's marker and places said marker in the position returned from the previous fucntion
5-) the updated board is displayed
5-) steps 3-5 are repeated for player #2
6-) check_win fucntion is used to check whether player 1 or player 2 have won the game.
